Name of Quantlet:    'ATSSB_ARMA_SSM'
Published in:        'Applied Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python Solutions Book'
Description:         'This Quantlet verifies algebraically and numerically that the state space models (8.4) and (8.5) specify the ARMA(1,1) model (8.3), demonstrating their equivalence through simulation comparison and scatter plot analysis.'
Keywords:            'state space model, ARMA, time series, simulation, equivalence, algebraic proof'
