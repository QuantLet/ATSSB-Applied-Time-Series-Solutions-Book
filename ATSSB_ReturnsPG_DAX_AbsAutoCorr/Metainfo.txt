Description:         'This Quantlet analyzes the autocorrelation properties of the absolute monthly return series of Procter & Gamble (PG) and the absolute daily log-returns of the DAX index. It demonstrates, using the Ljung-Box test, that both series exhibit strong autocorrelation in their absolute values, indicating volatility clustering and the non-independence of return magnitudes.'
