Name of Quantlet:    'ATSSB_VAR_Macro'
Published in:        'Applied Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python Solutions Book'
Description:         'This Quantlet analyzes US macroeconomic data (Real GDP, Real Consumption, Real Investment) from 1959Q1-2009Q3, transforms series to stationary quarterly growth rates via log-differencing, estimates a VAR(1) model, performs Granger causality tests, computes orthogonalized impulse response functions with bootstrap confidence intervals, and calculates forecast error variance decomposition to examine dynamic interactions between output, consumption, and investment.'
Keywords:            'VAR, vector autoregression, macroeconomics, GDP, consumption, investment, Granger causality, impulse response, FEVD, bootstrap, US economy, business cycle'
