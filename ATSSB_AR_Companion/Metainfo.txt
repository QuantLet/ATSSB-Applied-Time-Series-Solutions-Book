Name of Quantlet:    'ATSSB_AR_Companion'
Published in:        'Applied Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python Solutions Book'
Description:         'This Quantlet constructs the companion matrix state space representation for the causal AR(p) model, verifies equivalence with a numerical AR(3) simulation, and checks stability via eigenvalue analysis on the unit circle.'
Keywords:            'companion matrix, AR model, state space, eigenvalues, unit circle, stability, causality'
