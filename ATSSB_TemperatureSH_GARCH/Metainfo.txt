Name of Quantlet:    'ATSSB_TemperatureSH_GARCH'

Published in:        'Applied Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python Solutions Book'

Description:         'This Quantlet demonstrates how to model monthly temperature data for the Southern Hemisphere (1850â€“2007) using harmonic regression, SARIMA, and GARCH models. It identifies the presence of ARCH effects in the residuals and builds a GARCH model to capture volatility.'

Keywords:            'temperature, time series, SARIMA, GARCH, seasonal regression, volatility, Southern Hemisphere, climatology, ARCH effect'
